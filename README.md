## AI in Data Centers

## The Start of Accessible AI

* **LLAMA 2** (Large Language Model Meta AI)

* **Meta** was developed in 2004 then developed **LLAMA** in 2023 

* **Meta's** approach with **LLAMA 2** was to focus on making AI models that were more accessible to researchers and developers, rather than   just creating larger models.

* The company was funded by them **facebook dollars**. 

### Plans for a Large Consumer Base

* **Meta** wants to make AI more accessible to the average consumer rather than an enterpise company. It can be used by companies with an open business license making it more broadly accessible. 

* They are able to do this mainly because of the amount of Data Centers that are being built. AI is only as good as the equipment it runs on. No expense is spared making these LLMs run efficiently. Its essentially thousands of computers acting as one all learning.  Cloud AI services will be a big thing if not already. The infrastructure is being built to support massive models being trained. 

### Who Needs This?

* This is or can be used in many fields. Software developers, business startups, educators and students, it can also be used on the  enterprise level.

* Hobbyist if you  want to experiment in AI model building or training.

* AI could help a lot of businesses be successful. Automating task, analyzing data, security.

### How Has LLAMA 2 Helped me?
* I ***have not used LLAMA 2*** personally but Ive probably worked on a server it will be on.

* This business has given me the ability to understand the hardware aspect of AI. What goes into making it run efficiently is a big one. I have seen how these servers are built, how they are cooled and how they get their power. 

* If people are downloading and using LLAMA or LLAMA 2 then that means people are using their data centers which means Meta makes money.

* My company is at the forefront of all this new emerging technology. Its pretty wild learing everything that makes them run. Now itstime to learn how the programs work and how to program it. 

### Competitors

* **ChatGPT** By open AI

* **BERT** and its varients by **GOOGLE**

* **PaLM** by Google

* **Mistral**

* Whether in performance, efficiency, safety, or scalability, making the landscape of large language models highly competitive and dynamic.
